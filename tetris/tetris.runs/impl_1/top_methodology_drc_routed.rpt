Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.662 ns between game0/gamestart/map_reg[7]/C (clocked by clk) and game0/gamestart/difficulty_reg[7]/CE (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
